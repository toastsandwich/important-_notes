//  Animals    -->   Cat,Dog
//  (class)           (obj)
 
//  main focus on functions not on flow of data

//Object-oriented programming (OOP) is nothing but that which allows the writing of programs with the help of certain classes and real-time objects. We can say that     //this approach is very close to the real-world and its applications because the state and behaviour of these classes and objects are almost the same as real-world       //objects.

 /*What Are Class & Object? 
It is the basic concept of OOP; an extended concept of the structure used in C. It is an abstract and user-defined data type. It consists of several variables and       functions. The primary purpose of the class is to store data and information.*/
//IMPORTANT The class is not visible to the world, but the object is.
//An basic example for OOPs
#include<iostream>
